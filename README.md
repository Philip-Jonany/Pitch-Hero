# Pitch-Hero
## Project Description
Pitch Hero is a gamified pitch trainer intended to motivate users of all musical levels to improve their relative pitch sense and singing skills, potentially to achieve perfect or relative pitch. In this web-app game, players must sing the appropriate notes in time in order to evade the obstacles and survive. As they get more practice, they can keep surpassing their previous high scores and even rank themselves globally on the leaderboard.
